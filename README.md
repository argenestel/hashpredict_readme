# HashPredict: Aptos-based Prediction Marketplace

## Project Overview

HashPredict is an innovative prediction marketplace built on the [Aptos blockchain](https://aptoslabs.com/), leveraging [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) for a user-friendly experience. It aims to create a decentralized platform where users can participate in prediction markets, with seamless integration between blockchain technology and popular messaging platforms.

## Key Components

1. **Aptos Blockchain Integration**
   - Smart Contracts: Developed in [Move language](https://move-language.github.io/move/)
   - Transaction handling
   - Account management

2. **Telegram Bot Interface**
   - User interaction
   - Command processing
   - Notifications and alerts

3. **Prediction Market Logic**
   - Market creation and management
   - Betting mechanisms
   - Result resolution

4. **Fund Distribution System**
   - Automated payouts
   - Fee calculation and distribution

5. **Oracle System**
   - External data integration
   - Trusted data sources for market resolution

6. **User-Created Predictions**
   - Interface for users to create custom markets
   - Resource account management for user-created markets

7. **Dashboard**
   - Web interface for market overview and management
   - Built with modern web technologies ([React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), etc.)

## Relationship with Aptos

HashPredict leverages the Aptos blockchain for several critical aspects:

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**: The core logic of HashPredict is implemented as smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain, utilizing the Move programming language.

2. **Transaction Processing**: All bets, market creations, and resolutions are processed as transactions on the Aptos network, ensuring transparency and immutability.

3. **Account Management**: User accounts and balances are managed through [Aptos wallets](https://aptos.dev/concepts/accounts/), providing secure and decentralized asset management.

4. **Resource Accounts**: Utilizes Aptos' [resource account feature](https://aptos.dev/concepts/accounts/#resource-accounts) for managing user-created prediction markets, allowing for modular and scalable market creation.

5. **Token Integration**: If implemented, could use Aptos' native token or custom tokens for betting and rewards.

6. **Blockchain Security**: Benefits from the security and consensus mechanisms of the Aptos network.
